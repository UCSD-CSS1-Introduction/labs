# Labs Overview

Labs are intended to give you hands-on programming experience. 

You'll have a lab each week, which is intended to be completed during section. Note that if you can't physically attend section (or are working asynchronously), that's totally fine. The benefit of working during section is that you'll have quick access to the excellent Teaching Assistants (and your classmates) if you have questions.

## Labs are collaborative.  

You can (and should!) work with other classmates.  

In general, programming is often a team sport. You'll find that to be true in both software engineering and data science. Thus, labs are a good opportunity to practice working with others.

## Labs are graded for effort.  

You don't need to answer everything correctly. We'll grade you on whether you made a **concerted, good faith** effort to work on the questions in the lab.

This is necessarily a qualitative judgment. As a rough guide, if it's clear you've tried to answer most questions on a lab, you'll get full credit. 

Note that an "answer" could also simply be your notes on a particular question. For example, if you have an idea for how to answer a question, but you don't know how to implement it, you can write out your idea.
